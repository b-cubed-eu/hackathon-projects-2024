# Project 8: Virtual B3 - How reliability and uncertainty of biodiversity sampling affect SDM: build virtual species to cope with real problems!
## Abstract
In most cases, there is no complete information about the ‘reality’ of the focal species distribution besides the data collected in-situ. This is partly because the completeness of the data extracted from surveys (recorded in-situ) is difficult to measure. For instance, occurrence data from natural history collections, such as museum or herbaria collections, tend to be very incomplete with a relatively high amount of false absences—i.e., species occurrences missed by the observer in the field in case of a rare or difficult to identify species. Such incompleteness affects our ability to detect the real spatial coverage as well as the niche of a species with the records available. These limitations, in turn, can seriously flaw final results of species distribution models, by distorting the relationship between species occurrences and the underlying environmental patterns. Yet, quantifying sources of error is essential for proper descriptive or mechanistic modelling of species distributions, especially for conservation purposes (e.g. study the distribution of rare or/and endangered species, planning the expansion of protected areas or investigating the factors that can influence the distribution of a species in the future under global climatic change). Under this scenario, making use of simulated or in-silico datasets — the so-called ‘virtual ecologist’ approach — allows to generate distribution data with known ecological characteristics, helping to simulate and thus account for spatio-temporal and taxonomic noises, thanks to the complete control on the configuration of factors constraining the distribution of species. This approach could help to implement modelling techniques, leading to create further recommendations for conservation planning.
