# B-Cubed Hackathon: Guidelines

## Repositories

Repositories are expected to have at minimum:

- A `README.md` describing the software.
- A `LICENSE` file set to the MIT license

These options can be selected when [creating a repository](https://github.com/organizations/b-cubed-eu/repositories/new). Contact a technical coach to get access to the B-Cubed GitHub organization.
