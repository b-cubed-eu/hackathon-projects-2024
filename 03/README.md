# Project 3: Intelligent Nature Positive Impact Data for the Financial Services

## Abstract
The challenge: For the finance and insurance sectors to benefit from opportunities provided by nature and mitigate nature-related risks, reliable biodiversity monitoring data is a must.  Current state-of-the-art: To serve the need for simple, decision-ready metrics for biodiversity footprinting and the measurement of Nature Positive Impact, NatureMetrics has developed a core functionality to be delivered through NatureMetrics digital dashboard. To encompass the many dimensions of nature and service the Financial Services market, this framework combines biodiversity footprint, biodiversity impact and biodiversity trends metrics. Thus, this framework concomitantly measures biodiversity pressures and responses. Here, we propose the incorporation of standardized biodiversity data from B-Cube within iNPI, e.g., during design of open-source connectivity algorithms at high spatial resolution to link with the frameworkâ€™s restoration tracker element, to maximize the efficiency and return of investment of biodiversity management interventions, and demonstrate the high-resolution required for the Financial Services market.
