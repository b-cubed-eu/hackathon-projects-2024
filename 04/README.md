# Project 4: Irokube: Deep-SDM and Critical Habitats Mapping Empowered by Data Cubes

## Abstract

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) play a key role in conservation, offering a predictive framework to assess and proactively address changes in species distributions. By anticipating environmental shifts, SDMs enable targeted conservation strategies, crucial for effective biodiversity preservation. This project explores the added value of biodiversity data cubes to identify critical habitats using Deep-Learning Species Distribution Models (Deep-SDMs). The conventional Deep-SDM approach often relies on observation point data, which may struggle to capture the dynamic temporal evolution patterns of species distributions. Furthermore, training Deep-SDM with multiple observation sources implies manually compiling and ordering observations beforehand, which is time-consuming. The integration of biodiversity data cubes with environmental and remote sensing data will be performed to improve Deep-SDMs and thus better describe habitats. To illustrate this approach, we will explore a use case based on floristic data from France and Belgium. Using detailed floristic data from these two countries, we will demonstrate how the integration of data cubes can contribute to the modeling of species distribution over an extended geographical scale, taking into account environmental and remote sensing data. This case study will serve to highlight the potential benefits of using data cubes in biodiversity modeling. Improved species distribution modeling using biodiversity data cubes could offer a significant contribution to public policy, providing essential information for conservation and environmental management decision-making. These models make it possible to identify crucial areas for biodiversity, facilitating the design of targeted conservation policies. By anticipating the potential impacts of environmental changes, such as climate change, public policies can be proactively adapted to mitigate threats to flora and fauna.
