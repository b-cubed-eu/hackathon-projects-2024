# B-Cubed Hackathon: Hacking biodiversity data cubes for policy

This repository is for participants of the April 2024 [B-Cubed Hackathon](https://b-cubed.eu/b-cubed-hackathon) in Brussels. Use it to share ideas, create issues, manage projects, publish materials and develop code. We can also create a project-specific repository for you.
