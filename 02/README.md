# Project 2: Unveiling Ecological Dynamics Through Simulation and Visualization of Biodiversity Data Cubes

## Abstract

Simulation studies offer numerous benefits due to their ability to mimic real-world scenarios in controlled and customizable environments. Ecosystems and biodiversity data are very complex and involve a multitude of interacting factors. Simulations allow researchers to model and understand the complexity ofecological systems by varying parameters such as spatial and/or temporal clustering, species prevalence, etc. In this project, we aim to create a simulation framework for biodiversity data cubes using the R programming language. This can start from simulating multiple species distributed in a landscape over a temporal scope. In a second phase, the simulation of a variety of observation processes and effort can generate actual occurrence datasets. Based on their (simulated) spatial uncertainty, occurrences can then be designated to a grid to form a data cube. Nevertheless, we encourage you to think out of the box and provide new ideas as well. For the occurrence-to-cube designation, R code is already available. The simulation framework can be used to assess multiple research questions under different parameter settings, such as the effect of clustering on occurrence-to-grid designation and the effect of different patterns of missingness on data quality and indicator robustness. Simulation studies can incorporate scenarios with missing data, enabling researchers to assess the impact of data gaps on analyses. Understanding how missing data influences results is crucial for improvingdata collection strategies and addressing potential biases. With this, the secondary objective of the simulation study is to develop a visualisation tool for the simulated cubes. This tool aims to enhancethe understanding of data clustering and missingness within the simulated environment. By creating a visual representation, researchers can effectively analyse and interpret patterns of clustered data as well as identify areas where data is missing. This visualization capability contributes to a more comprehensive exploration of the simulated scenarios, allowing for deeper insights into the behaviourof data within the context of the study.
