# Project 9: Species occurrence cube portability
## Abstract
Species occurrence cubes will be available in a limited range of formats, which may hinder the reuse of these cubes in the future.  This project aims to increase the range of formats that species occurrence cubes will be available and make them as ready-for-use as possible.
