# Project 11: GUI for general biodiversity indicators

## Abstract

Biodiversity indicators provide essential information for policy-makers, but often are only accessible to those with an understanding of coding and the time to learn a new package, namely research scientists. That means many users must rely on ready-made or commissioned analyses. Within the EU-project B-Cubed (https://b-cubed.eu/) we are providing flexible workflows to align with policy objectives. But to be truly user-friendly, these should be provided in graphical, interactive format that does not require the user to understanding coding. The goal of this hackathon project is to develop a front end for a general biodiversity indicators package e.g. in the form of a Shiny app. The indicator package already exists and can calculate and plot a number of indicators from occurrence cubes, which will serve as a basis for selecting indicators. The use of additional indicator to be considered can be explored within the project. The front end should provide a graphical user interface between the user and the existing package functions. When provided with an occurrence cube as input, the GUI should present the user with a map and drop-down lists of taxa (e.g. species), indicators, and resolutions, and basic information and simple statistics about the respective data cube. The user should be able to select the region(s) of the map he wants to include in the analysis either by clicking and dragging to select by coordinates or by selecting specific countries by clicking on them. The GUI should then show the resulting indicator map and allow the user to save it and possibly interact with it by moving the mouse over grid cells to show specific values or zooming in and out.
