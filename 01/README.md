# Project 1: Data cubes for landscape approach in biodiversity conservation across farmers

## Abstract

In the Netherlands, collective contracting of farmers to make biodiversity and habitat conservation on a landscape level more ecologically efficient, has been implemented since 2014. Multi-dimensional data cubes can be a great vehicle to integrate data across farmlands from individual data contributors and eventually monitor conservation efforts on a landscape level. A landscape level approach is crucial for conservation of biodiversity and habitats as  farmland birds and other species donâ€™t adhere to the individual farmland level, hence their conservation requires cooperation across farmers.
