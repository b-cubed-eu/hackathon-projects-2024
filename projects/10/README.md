# Project 10: CUBIT - Integrating species occurrrences from different sources into Data Cubes and facilitate detection of data imbalance, biases, scale and other effects.

## Abstract

We developed a workflow CUBIT that will allow to map private data into Darwin Core Standards and generate a species occurrences cube from your own data and merge it with GBIF species occurrences cubes. CUBIT aims to help mobilize private data more efficiently and integrate it with publicly available data, facilitating data exploration in support of biodiversity assessments.

Traditional biodiversity monitoring programmes usually hold well-curated data of species occurrences, with high spatial and temporal resolutions but often only for restricted areas. In recent years, technological developments along with online digital platforms have increased the amount of information available on species occurrences, both from the scientific community as well as from community-based contributions such as citizen science. The increase in data availability and accessibility poses the challenge of integrating such highly heterogenous data sets on species occurrences, but in the context of the implementation of biodiversity policy objectives at wide scales, making the most of all information available is crucial. While the importance of integrating species ocurrences information from different data sources cannot be overstated, we can expect that variability in sampling effort, sampling methods, spatial and temporal resolution and coverage, as well as data confidence levels, will introduce bias in the assessments.
