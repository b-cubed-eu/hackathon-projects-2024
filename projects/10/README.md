# Project 10: Effects of integrating species occurrrences from different sources into Data Cubes: facilitating detection of data balance, biases, scale and other effects.

## Abstract

Traditional biodiversity monitoring programmes usually hold well-curated data of species occurrences, with high spatial and temporal resolutions but often only for restricted areas. In recent years, technological developments along with online digital platforms have increased the amount of information available on species occurrences, both from the scientific community as well as from community-based contributions such as citizen science. The increase in data availability and accessibility poses the challenge of integrating such highly heterogenous data sets on species occurrences, but in the context of the implementation of biodiversity policy objectives at wide scales, making the most of all information available is crucial. While integration of species ocurrences from different data sources cannot be discarded, we can expect that variability in sampling methods, spatial and temporal resolution and coverage, as well as data confidence levels, will introduce bias in the assessments.
