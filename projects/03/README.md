# Project 3: Intelligent Nature Positive Impact Data for the Financial Services

## Abstract

Numerous vineyards are emerging across northern Europe, including regions such as Britain, driven by forecasts of climate change facilitating favorable wine production conditions in the future. Nevertheless, financial institutions face challenges in assessing the risk associated with agricultural loans that support the establishment of these vineyards.
The objective of this hackathon is to pioneer a machine learning methodology enabling financial institutions to effectively gauge the investment risk associated with various potential vineyard ventures. This can be achieved by suing  B-cubes data as in input and comparing the relative suitability for grape growing versus their suitability for pest species for vineyards in a selected region
