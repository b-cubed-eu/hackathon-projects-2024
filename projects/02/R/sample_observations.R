#' Sample observations from a larger occurrence dataset
#'
#' The function samples observations from occurrences based on detection probability and sampling bias.
#'
#' @param occurrences An sf object with POINT geometry.
#' @param detection_probability A numeric value between 0 and 1, corresponding to the probability of detection of the species.
#' @param sampling_bias `"no_bias"`, `"polygon"` or `"manual"`. The method used to generate a sampling bias. `"polygon"`: bias the sampling in a polygon. Provide your polygon to `bias_area`. Provide bias strength to `bias_strength`. `"manual"`: bias the sampling manually via a raster. Provide your raster layer in which each cell contains the probability to be sampled to `bias_weights`.
#' @param bias_area `NA` or an sf object with POLYGON geometry. Only used if `sampling_bias = "polygon"`. The area in which the sampling will be biased.
#' @param bias_strength `NA` or a positive numeric value. Only used if `sampling_bias = "polygon"`. The strength of the bias to be applied in the biased area (as a multiplier). Above 1, area will be oversampled. Below 1, area will be undersampled. For example, a value of 50 will result in 50 times more samples within the `bias_area` than outside. Conversely, a value of 0.5 will result in half less samples within the `bias_area` than outside.
#' @param bias_weights `NA` or a raster layer (sf object with POLYGON geometry, or SpatRaster object). Only used if `sampling_bias = "manual"`. The raster of bias weights to be applied to the sampling of occurrences. Higher weights mean a higher probability of sampling. Weights can be numeric values between 0 and 1 or positive integers that will be rescaled to values between 0 and 1.
#' @param coordinate_uncertainty_meters A positive numeric value or vector with length `nrow(occurrences)` describing the uncertainty in meters around each observation.
#' @param seed A positive numeric value. The seed for random number generation to make results reproducible. If `NA` (the default), no seed is used.
#'
#' @returns An sf object with POINT geometry containing the locations of the sampled observations, a `detection_probability` column containing the detection probability for each observation (will be the same for all), a `bias_weight` column containing the sampling probability based on sampling bias, a `sampling_probability` column containing the combined sampling probability from detection probability and sampling bias, and a `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters` column containing the coordinate uncertainty for each observation.
